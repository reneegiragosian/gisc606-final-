    What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
Remote sensing and mission planning as a GIS Analyst for the US Army/ Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst

    What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?

sUAV remote sensing with LiDAR and multispectal imagery, to make orthomasaic models

    What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
More coding!! Leaning coding languages function the same as learning any other language. It will take time...first comes being able to interpret and understand, then being able to regurtitate the language follows with more time, exposure and practice. I would also like work on obtaining my sUAV pilot license.
